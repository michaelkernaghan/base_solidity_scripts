# Base Solidity Scripts for Web3 Course

Welcome to base_solidity_scripts, a foundational repository created as part of an intensive course designed to bridge the gap between web2 and web3 development for experienced programmers. This collection of Solidity scripts is specifically crafted to accompany a curriculum that emphasizes the similarities and differences between web3 and traditional web development environments.

## Course Overview
The course is meticulously designed to teach web3 concepts and the Solidity programming language to web2 developers rapidly and thoroughly. It dives deep into the unique aspects of web3 development, comparing and contrasting it with familiar web2 paradigms.

### Prerequisites
Before embarking on this course, participants should:

- Have several years of programming experience, preferably in an object-oriented language.
- Understand the basics of the Ethereum blockchain and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- Be comfortable with at least one curly-bracket programming language (e.g., JavaScript, C++, Java).

### Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:

- Gain an introduction to Solidity and understand its necessity for writing smart contracts.
- Learn about the evolution, strengths, and weaknesses of Solidity.
- Deploy and test smart contracts using the Remix IDE.
- Understand and implement basic and advanced functions, including pure and view functions.
- Explore data storage, control structures, arrays, mappings, and structs within the context of Solidity.
- Delve into advanced topics like contract inheritance, imports, error handling, and the new keyword for creating contracts.
- Deploy contracts to a testnet and interact with them on platforms like Etherscan.

### Scripts Included
The repository includes scripts that demonstrate fundamental and advanced Solidity concepts aligned with the course's curriculum, such as:

- FavoriteRecords: Manages a collection of favorite records, introducing mappings, custom errors, and array manipulation.
- BasicMath: Demonstrates safe mathematical operations with checks for overflow and underflow.
- ArraysExercise: Explores operations on dynamic arrays, including appending, filtering, and resetting.

### Getting Started with Remix IDE

Remix is the recommended IDE for this course due to its accessibility and ease of use for compiling, deploying, and interacting with Solidity contracts.

### Contribution
Contributions to enhance or extend the functionality of these scripts are welcome. They provide an excellent opportunity for learners to engage with the course material actively.
